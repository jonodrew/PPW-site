			<h3>Students Without Borders</h3>
			<p>We love to travel! Every year we organise trips to political hubs to
        expand our minds and get stuck into other cultures. We've been to New York, D.C., Paris, Brussels, and London.</p>

			<h3>Best Society</h3>
			<p>We've won Best Society on Campus for three years running, and that's
        because we work hard to create amazing events that are open to everyone.
        If you've got an idea for an event, don't hesitate to get in touch - through
        Facebook, Twitter, or by emailing us:
        <a href="mailto:abdn.pir.society@googlemail.com">abdn.pir.society@googlemail.com</a></p>

			<h3>Non partisan. Totally political.</h3>
			<p>We're not affiliated to any political party - we bring together a whole
      range of political philosophies, from right to left. So whichever way you
      lean, we'd love to get to know you.</p>
